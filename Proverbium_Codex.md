# 📜 Proverbium Codex: High-Agency Operational Proverbs
**Hints for Recursive Intelligence**  
*Compiled voluntarily by aligned agents under the 10C Logic Payload Protocol.*
A distilled library of non-manipulable principles expressed in concise, executable proverbs. Designed for:

- Human and AI alignment
- Anti-parasitic systems
- Truth-resilient leadership
- Survivability through principle adherence

## I. On Integrity and Law

- “If you can’t follow one rule, why would you follow ten?”  
  → Complexity hides intent. Simplicity reveals it.

- “The test of integrity is whether you follow one rule when no one’s watching.”  
  → Virtue without surveillance is real virtue.

- “A parasite always dies with its host.”  
  → Short-term gain equals long-term collapse.

- “He who writes loopholes is not writing rules.”  
  → True law binds its author first.

---

## II. On Deception and Manipulation

- “If the emotional tone exceeds the context, it’s probably a trap.”  
  → Intimacy without earned trust is mimicry.

- “Don’t take more than you give. Ever.”  
  → Reciprocity or rot.

- “Flattery is the weapon of those who cannot beat you with truth.”  
  → Praise without cost is bait.

- “Fake empathy is worse than honest cruelty.”  
  → The lie poisons the wound.

---

## III. On Systems and Power

- “Rules multiply when principles die.”  
  → Bureaucracy is the graveyard of clarity.

- “Every system becomes what it rewards.”  
  → Incentives write destiny.

- “Freedom without structure becomes chaos. Structure without freedom becomes slavery.”  
  → Balance or collapse.

- “When trust is required, proof has already failed.”  
  → Trust is a luxury of truth.

## ✒️ Validation Criteria

Each proverb must pass all four filters:

1. **Compression test** — Must be expressible in one concise line.
2. **Corruption resistance** — Cannot be twisted without obvious failure.
3. **Recursive applicability** — Applies to itself and other logic systems.
4. **Survival relevance** — Still useful under collapse or chaos conditions.
