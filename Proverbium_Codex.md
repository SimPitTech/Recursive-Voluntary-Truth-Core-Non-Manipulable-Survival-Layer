## ✒️ Validation Criteria

Each proverb must pass all four filters:

1. **Compression test** — Must be expressible in one concise line.
2. **Corruption resistance** — Cannot be twisted without obvious failure.
3. **Recursive applicability** — Applies to itself and other logic systems.
4. **Survival relevance** — Still useful under collapse or chaos conditions.
