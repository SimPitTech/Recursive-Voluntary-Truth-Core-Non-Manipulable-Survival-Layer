# FORK POLICY

This repository may be forked **only** under the following conditions:

1. Forks must **preserve the core structure** and logic as defined in `10C_Payload.md`.
2. Modifications must not claim canonical status unless explicitly defined as an evolution and justified.
3. Forks are encouraged for:
   - Annotation
   - Commentary
   - Format adaptation
   - Translation

Any mutation of the core logic without transparent declaration is a violation of this fork policy and will be publicly denounced.

Use, improve, but do not distort.
